# **Encrypted Document NFT System**

## **Overview**
This system provides a solution for managing offline credentials like passports, driving licenses, and important documents by storing them as private, encrypted NFTs on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Users can securely upload their documents, which are encrypted and stored on IPFS, and minted as NFTs into their wallets.
